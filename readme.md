Now let's have a hands-on walkthrough in Python. Here's what we are going to do:

1. Check the version of the node we are connected to.
2. Get pending transactions from the mempool.
3. Get a pending block.
4. Compare pending transactions from the mempool and pending block.
5. Compare the pending block and the block with the same number that has been validated and added to the blockchain.
